                            <p>
                                Thank you for visiting the CLARIN Tool Portal prototype.
                                Given the prototype status of this service, it is
                                currently limited in terms of its functionality, content
                                and documentation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The aim of the CLARIN Tool Portal is to offer a uniform
                                interface for searching and discovering tools and 
                                services that work with language resources, or can help
                                in producing, or managing such resources, and that are
                                relevant to the CLARIN community.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you are looking for tools or resources and would
                                like to explore beyond what is currently available
                                from this prototype, we suggest visiting the existing
                                catalogues and other resources for discovering language
                                tools and services that are listed below on this page.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We appreciate any feedback or suggestions related to
                                the CLARIN Tool Portal!
